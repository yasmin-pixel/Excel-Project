# ‚òï Coffee Orders Data Analysis (2020‚Äì2024)

## Overview
This repository presents a data analysis project exploring patterns and trends in coffee orders over a multi-year period. The project investigates customer preferences, seasonal demand shifts, and order behavior, providing visual insights to inform operational decisions for caf√©s or coffee retailers.

This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, trend analysis, and interactive visualization using Python. All code and visualizations are developed within a Jupyter/Google Colab Notebook environment.

## Key Findings & Insights

Some of the major insights derived from the coffee order data include:

- **Size Preferences**: Medium size was the most frequently chosen across all coffee types.
- **Repeat Customers**: A subset of customer IDs accounted for the majority of frequent orders, indicating loyalty patterns.

## Observations & Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

- **Loyalty Programs**: Target high-frequency customers with rewards to boost retention.
- **Morning Promotions**: Consider running promotions between 8:00‚Äì10:30 AM to further capitalize on peak traffic.
- **Size-Based Bundling**: Promote bundle deals on medium-sized drinks, which are the most popular.

---

## Limitations & Future Work

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset lacks detailed demographic data, which could enrich customer profiling.
- **No Location Data**: Regional analysis is not possible without caf√© location information.
- **Menu Evolution**: Coffee menu changes over time aren‚Äôt clearly marked ‚Äî this could influence trend interpretation.

**Future Additions Might Include:**
- Integration with POS data for real-time monitoring.
- Sentiment analysis from customer reviews (if available).
- Predictive modeling for sales forecasting.
